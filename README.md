# Password Generator Starter Code 8/20/2020

* This project was designed as a weekly challenge from UCF's coding bootcamp.
* For this project we were required to submit a password generator using JavaScript.
* To complete this project, I used a few different techniques including loops and strings.
* The JavaScript page has comments that a future developer can use in case there are any bugs or even for myself as future reference.
* The project has been deployed to GitHub Pages.
